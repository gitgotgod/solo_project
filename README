Combined the login and registration page to reduce unnecessary extra pages.
Moved events calendar to its own separate page. Events will be managed and manually edited by the owner (me).
The team stats will also be editied manually by the owner (route is /adjust).
Standings will only show the current standings for the registered users team - will not show standings for all teams - this will be implemented later to the main dashboard.
